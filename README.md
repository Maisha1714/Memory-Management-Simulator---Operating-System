# Memory-Management-Simulator---Operating-System

A Memory Management Simulator is a tool designed to help students and professionals understand how memory is managed within an operating system. These simulators visually and interactively demonstrate how memory is allocated, deallocated, and managed as processes are executed.

For example, some simulators allow users to input processes with specific sizes and durations. These processes are then allocated memory chunks according to different memory management algorithms like First Fit, Best Fit,Worst Fit
